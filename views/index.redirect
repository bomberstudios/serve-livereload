Serve has a special file type for mapping HTTP redirects. Redirects make nice
end points for form posts or short URLs.

Redirect URLs can be fully formed, like this:

http://wiseheartdesign.com/

Or, relative to the site root, like this:

/action

Extra lines at the beginning of a redirect file are ignored. By convention,
the last line of a redirect file is the URL to redirect to:

/welcome
