# serve-livereload

This is a skeleton for a @jlong/serve project, including support for [LiveReload](http://livereload.com).


## setup

Clone the repo, then run:

    $ bundle install
    $ guard

Open a new terminal window and start serve:

    $ serve

Now you can open http://0.0.0.0:4000/ and anytime you make changes to any of your scss, erb or haml files, your browser will update the page. Cool feature: scss files are updated without reloading the page!
